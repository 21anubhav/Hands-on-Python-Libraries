📊 Sugarcane Production Data Analysis
📌 Overview

This project analyzes global sugarcane production data to uncover trends, top producers, and key insights. The dataset contains information about sugarcane production in different countries, including acreage (hectares) and production (tons).

The project focuses on:

Cleaning and preprocessing the dataset

Exploring production patterns across countries

Handling missing values and data inconsistencies

Preparing the dataset for meaningful visualizations and insights

🗂️ Dataset

File Used: List of Countries by Sugarcane Production.csv

Attributes:

Country – Name of the country

Acreage(Hectare) – Area under sugarcane cultivation

Production(Tons) – Total sugarcane production

⚙️ Steps Performed

Data Loading

Read the dataset using pandas.

Data Cleaning

Removed unwanted columns (e.g., Unnamed: 0).

Fixed numeric formatting in Production(Tons).

Renamed inconsistent column names.

Handled missing values (dropna).

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Checked dataset shape and structure.

Analyzed missing values and unique values.

Summarized production across countries.

Visualization (to be added / recommended)

Bar plots of top sugarcane producers.

Distribution of acreage vs. production.

Trend comparisons between top countries.

📈 Future Work

Add interactive visualizations (Matplotlib / Seaborn / Plotly).

Compare productivity (production per hectare).

Build a prediction model for sugarcane yield (optional).
